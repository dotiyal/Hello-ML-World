## NOTE:
I treated this problem at large-scale, as the dataset can be very large (e.g., >100GB) and it will not fit into the RAM.
So I divide the dataset into chunks (chunk_size = 10000)

## Steps to run the code:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code.

## Libraries used:
1. Pandas
2. sqllite3
