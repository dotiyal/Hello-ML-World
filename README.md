# Hello-ML-World
Quickstart for the beginner.

Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

Machine Learning can be classified into three types:

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

#### Note: Every individual program has two files (fileName).py and (fileName).ipynb. The .py files are pure python code files, And .ipynb files are for program explanation.

### Installation:
##### Online Environment
Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with
Zero configuration required
Free access to GPUs
Easy sharing.

##### Offline Enviroment
If you want to run these programs offline, then you should download Anaconda or mini Anaconda.

### Credits:
Machine Learning Foundations is a free training course where you’ll learn the fundamentals of building machine learned models using TensorFlow with Laurence Moroney.
