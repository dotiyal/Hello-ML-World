# Hello-ML-World
Quickstart for the beginner.

Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

Machine Learning can be classified into three types:

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

#### Note: Every individual program has two files (fileName).py and (fileName).ipynb. The .py files are pure python code files, And .ipynb files are for program explanation.

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with
Zero configuration required
Free access to GPUs
Easy sharing.
